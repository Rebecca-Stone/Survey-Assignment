# Survey-Assinment
A unit 1 Advanced Assignment 
Overview

This is a timed programming challenge modeled after an actual engineering problem we
tackle at Blueberry Pediatrics - surveying a parent who has a sick child about their child’s
symptoms.

The problem

Imagine this scene: A parent who uses Blueberry Pediatrics has a child with a cough, and
they have just opened up the Blueberry website and indicated in it that their child has a
cough. The Blueberry website is now going to survey the parent for details about their
child's symptoms, drawing from a bank of questions. The intelligent survey system asks
different questions based on the parent's responses to prior questions, adapting the
survey to the child’s symptoms.

In this version of the survey, all questions are Yes/No questions.

Your task

Complete the webpage which asks the user a series of questions about the symptoms that
their child is experiencing. The survey webpage has only been partially completed, and you
need to finish it. Open up challenge.html, read its contents and complete it. Your answer
should be a very basic webpage using Javascript and HTML which:

  - Displays questions in the correct order, one question at a time.
  - Takes Yes/No responses, stores the responses somehow, and adapts the survey
based on those responses.
  - Displays some kind of completion message when a parent has finished the survey.
 
If there are any cases of ambiguity in how to implement something, please use your own
best judgement, and feel free to add code comments describing your decision.
Implementation

-  Your implementation should be as general as possible.
-  Your code should be clean, use reasonable variable and function names, and be
commented where appropriate.
-  Your implementation should work regardless of the number of questions in the
ALL_QUESTIONS object. Future engineers should be able to add values to ALL_QUESTIONS
following the same format as the existing questions in there, and it should work naturally.

Notes

Advanced Assignment - Survey Task
 
-  Feel free to use any online resources such as Google, StackOverflow.
-  You are also free to load in any 3rd party libraries you’d like, such as jQuery.
The only exception is libraries explicitly for surveys - please do NOT use any
survey libraries.
-  Since this is timed, we suggest not using any libraries that would take more
than 2-3 minutes to set up. That might mean avoiding using React, Angular, Vue, etc.
Note this is just a tip based on time and you are more than free to use anything
you’d like :)

Submission

When you are finished, submit your response by emailing back your updated
‘challenge.html’ file.

Please DO use the entire 90 minutes, if you finish early use the remaining time to
clean up and comment your code, and to style the webpage. If your solution isn’t
complete, that’s okay - send what you have when you hit 90 minutes! We can’t
accept late submissions.

Thanks!
